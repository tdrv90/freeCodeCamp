// Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings "My name is " and " and I am well!"


// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "John";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
