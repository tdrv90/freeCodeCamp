// (1) Check the spelling of the two variables used in the netWorkingCapital 
// calculation, the console output should show that "Net working capital is: 2".
// (2) There should be no instances of mis-spelled variables in the code.
// (3) The receivables variable should be declared and used properly 
// in the code.
// (4) There should be no instances of mis-spelled variables in the code.
// (5) The payables variable should be declared and used properly in the code.
