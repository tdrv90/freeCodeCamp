## (1) Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)
to be completed

## (2) JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification (300 hours)

#### 1. Basic JavaScript (110 of 110 challenges done)
This section will cover basic JavaScript programming concepts, which range from variables and arithmetic to objects and loops. 
#### 2. ES6 (31 of 31 challenges done)
The most recent standardized version is called ECMAScript 6 (ES6), released in 2015. This new version of the language adds some powerful features that will be covered in this section of challenges, including:
 - Arrow functions
 - Classes
 - Modules
 - Promises
 - Generators
 - let and const
#### 3. Regular Expressions (33 of 33 challenges done)
Regular expressions are special strings that represent a search pattern. Also known as "regex" or "regexp", they help programmers match, search, and replace text. Regular expressions can appear cryptic because a few characters have special meaning. The goal is to combine the symbols and text into a pattern that matches what you want, but only what you want. This section will cover the characters, a few shortcuts, and the common uses for writing regular expressions.
#### 4. Debugging (12 of 12 challenges done)
This section covers a couple helpful tools to find bugs, and some of the common forms they take. Fortunately, debugging is a learnable skill that just requires a little patience and practice to master.
#### 5. Basic Data Structures (20 of 20 challenges done)
This section will teach you how to manipulate arrays, as well as access and copy the information within them. It will also teach you how to manipulate and access the data within JavaScript objects, using both dot and bracket notation. When you're done with this section, you should understand the basic properties and differences between arrays and objects, as well as how to choose which to use for a given purpose.
#### 6. Basic Algorithm Scripting (16 of 16 challenges done)
In this section we will learn to solve basic algorithm problems using JavaScript. This will help you improve your problem solving skills and prepare you to later solve more complex problems.
#### 6. Object Oriented Programming (26 of 26 challenges done)
This section covers object oriented programming principles in JavaScript.
#### 7. Functional Programming (24 of 24 challenges done)
The functional programming software development approach breaks a program into small, testable parts. This section covers basic functional programming principles in JavaScript.
#### 8. Intermediate Algorithm Scripting (21 of 21 challenges done)
The following challenges are part of FCC's Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenges. These should prepare you to complete the final challenges for the JavaScript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification.

These challenges will allow you to test how much you have learned and which parts you may need to review again before starting the projects.
#### 9. JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects (5 of 5 challenges done)
These challenges will be similar to the algorithm scripting challenges but more difficult. This will allow you to prove how much you have learned.
